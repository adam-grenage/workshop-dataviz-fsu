# Primer on data management using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
Why does a workshop on data visualization go over data management? Two two go hand in hand! In practice, I spend the majority of my time on data management and analysis and only 10% to 20% on data visualization. Getting data in the right shape and format is a prerequisite for good data visualization. 

Consider the data science workflow below.
