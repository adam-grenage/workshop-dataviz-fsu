# Roadmap for this workshop

## Day 1: Basics of data visualization

1. Principles of good graphics
2. The grammar of graphics
3. Building a graph in `ggplot2`
4. Primer on data management using `dplyr` and `tidyr`

## Day 2: Descriptive data visualization

1. Changing the appearance of charts
  * Labels
  * Themes
  * Colors
  * Scales
2. Scatterplots
3. Heatmaps


## Day 3 Visualizing statistical analyses

1. Visualizing regression results
  * Coefficient plot
  * Visualizing substantive effects

2. Maps in `R`


# Principles of good graphics

Add example similar to https://www.yan-holtz.com/PDF/Intro_Dataviz.pdf. A simple data set, multiple different ways of visualizing it.

# Primer on data management using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
Why does a workshop on data visualization go over data management? Two two go hand in hand! In practice, I spend the majority of my time on data management and analysis and only 10% to 20% on data visualization. Getting data in the right shape and format is a prerequisite for good data visualization. 

Consider the data science workflow below.
