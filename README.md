# Software requirements
You should have both [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) installed on your machine. 

# Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites for this workshop. However, I am assuming that participants have a basic understanding of `R` programming, in particular:

* Setting a working directory,
* Installing and loading packages,
* Reading and writing data,
* Basic data formats (scalar, vector, data frame),
* Basic variable types (numeric, character, factor, logical),
* Basic vector and data frame operations, such as subsetting, transforming variables, merging, reshaping, etc.

If you are unfamiliar with `R` or would like to brush up on your skills, take a look at my [intro to data management workshop](https://github.com/thereseanders/Workshop-DataManagement-tidyverse). The first two sessions go over basic `R` functionality and programming principles. The latter four sessions introduce data management operations using packages from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) suite. I also recommend taking a look at [`R` for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) website and/or book for a great resource on learning `R` and data management.
